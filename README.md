# A* Search Algorithm
 A* Search algorithm programmed with my partner for our Principles of Artificial Intelligence course to solve an 8 tile puzzle. The program gives the user the option of selecting the heuristic of their choosing from:
 
  a.) the number of misplaced tiles
  
  b.) the Manhattan distance
  
  to solve the puzzle. Then lists the number of steps needed to solve, the steps to solve, and finally how many nodes were explored before coming to the solution.
